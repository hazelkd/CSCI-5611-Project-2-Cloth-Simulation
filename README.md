Cloth Simulation Project and Video Demonstration: https://sites.google.com/view/csci5611p2/home

General Assignment Description:
This assignment focuses on using numerical integration to simulate physical systems that follow
well-known rules. Our focus will be on phenomena which are well described by Partial Differential
Equations (PDEs) such as simple, physically-based models of rope, cloth, and water. 

For our specific project, my partner and I chose to create a cloth falling over a ball.
This project demonstrated many topics that we had learned for most of the semester in class.
We created a rope simulation that we then turned into a cloth simulation by connecting all of the ropes,
to create a sort of huge spring system, that we can then place a material over to turn into cloth.
Our multiple spring system supports collisions and collision detection. We created the cloth to sense
when it is colliding with the ball, so it falls and reacts as a normal cloth would.
We made a whole 3D environment that was navigable by a camera view that we created, and added air drag
to our system so the cloth would fall more realistically.
Overall, this project consisted of a lot of work, but we were very happy with our cloth outcome.
Further details and a video demonstration is at the link at the top of this file.
